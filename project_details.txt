Project Title: Vibe Check - Real-Time Personality Quiz App

Project Overview:
"Vibe Check" is a fun, shareable personality quiz app that analyzes users' answers to determine their current "vibe" (e.g., Chill Lo-Fi Cat, Cosmic Meme Overlord). After completing the quiz, users are shown their result along with real-time statistics showing how many users got each vibe.

Key Features:
- 5–7 quirky, personality-based quiz questions
- Based on answers, a “vibe” is assigned with a name, color, emoji, and description
- Real-time percentage breakdown of how many people fall under each vibe category
- Shareable result pages with emojis, GIFs, and social media buttons
- Live updates of results using Firebase or Supabase

Tech Stack:
Frontend:
- React.js (for dynamic UI)
- Tailwind CSS (for quick, beautiful styling)

Backend:
- Firebase Realtime Database or Supabase (for storing quiz responses and live analytics)
- Optional: Firebase Authentication (if user login or leaderboards are needed)

Deployment:
- Vercel or Netlify (for free and fast deployment)

UI/UX Design Notes:
- Use emoji sliders or radio buttons for quiz questions
- Result screen should have:
  - Vibe title (e.g., “Chaos Goblin Energy”)
  - Description (fun, meme-style)
  - Emojis or GIFs
  - Real-time bar/pie chart showing result distribution
- Option to retake quiz or share results

Example Quiz Questions:
1. What’s your ideal weekend plan?
2. Pick a song that describes your mood today
3. Choose a snack right now:
4. What’s your favorite aesthetic?
5. How do you usually text your friends?
6. If life was a game, you would be...
